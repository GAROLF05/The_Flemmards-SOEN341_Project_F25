## üéØ Implementation Highlights

### 1. Comprehensive Status Management
- Organizations: `pending` ‚Üí `approved/rejected/suspended`
- Events: Separate `status` (lifecycle) and `moderationStatus` (approval workflow)

### 2. Notification System (Mock)
- Organization approval/rejection notifications
- Event moderation notifications
- Ready for production email service integration
- In-memory storage for demo purposes

### 3. Security Features
- QR code re-use detection with administrator alerts
- Audit logging for all critical actions
- Proper authentication/authorization on all endpoints

### 4. Admin Dashboard APIs
- Get organizations by status
- Get events by moderation status
- Get pending approvals/moderations
- View notification history

### 5. Data Export
- CSV export with comprehensive attendee data
- Error handling for all edge cases
- Check-in status tracking
